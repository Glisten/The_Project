Software Zero: Global-Scale Collaboration
=========================================

Contributors: Harlan T Wood, Jack Senechal, Travis Wellman, Adam Apollo 

The mission of Software Zero is to create a platform for swarm intelligence 
to collaborate on a project, while retaining the edits and contributions of 
every author throughout the history of the collaboration. Contributors do not 
have to agree on a single version; each author can maintain their own latest 
version. This “branching” of creative works encourages a diversity of perspectives 
that can be exchanged and interwoven in a creative network of any scale. Authors 
can create unlimited branches, easily view differences between branches, and 
merge in changes from other versions and authors.

The Software Zero launch rolls up the four main project areas of enlightened 
structure – creative collaboration, [trust and reputation systems][2], [visual 
navigation of data][3], and the [underlying data graph][4] – into one product 
release. That is, it’s the basic elements of each of the enlightened structure 
project areas that make a great, usable, consumer-oriented web application 
to get the ball rolling. This is just the beginning, but we want it to be a 
great beginning, with solid tech and features that are useful for _you_.

## Academic Applications

A primary application of the enlightened structure technology is the Massively 
Parallel Academic Research System (MPARCS). As Wikipedia has opened the encyclopedia 
by leveraging the “wisdom of crowds”, so enlightened structure will open the 
cutting edges of human knowledge, as represented in academic research. Research 
papers, or even seeds of papers, placed into the public domain with appropriate 
supporting technology, will allow others to build on these works, while still 
preserving intellectual ownership of ideas through total transparency and traceability. 

Academic research builds upon other research. What if this could be done incrementally, 
as a living conversation? What if instead of having to wait for a whole “new” 
idea, a paper could be improved on incrementally, by anyone who had an improvement 
– minor or revolutionary? Then the world of research and knowledge advancement 
could become truly alive, constantly morphing, reorganizing, improving the 
human knowledge ecosystem.

The technology involved is an extension of the “wiki” concept popularized by 
Wikipedia. But instead of trying to have a single, definitive version of each 
article, MPARCS allows each user to copy other users’ articles, for editing, 
combining, remixing.

## Reputation and Content Ratings

Ratings are an extremely important part of enlightened structure. Suppose an 
article on a physics simulation algorithm spawns versions created by thousands 
of interested users. When the original author wants to review the most interesting 
revisions, considering whether to incorporate any of the new ideas into their 
own latest update, they can turn to peer ratings as a starting place, to locate 
the most interesting content.

A sophisticated ratings system will allow ratings at several levels: from the 
entry level, where any person can rate any article, up to the expert level, 
where articles deemed particularly “interesting” by the open ratings community 
can be assessed by credentialed experts in a given field. Users will also be 
able to rate other users, so that each user can create a personalized ratings 
matrix, where the ratings given to articles by users they trust will be weighted 
more significantly than those of users unknown to them.

## New Models of IP Ownership

enlightened structure will leverage the same collective power as Wikipedia, 
while also allowing for individual ownership – each user can copy and edit 
articles that are in the public domain, but the original article will stay 
intact, allowing each contributor to receive full credit for their contribution. 
The system will allow users to see the complete history of any article, tracing 
its evolution through various authors, and providing a view of the differences 
between any given versions.

## Maximally Permissive Licensing

enlightened structure will be released as free, open source software, utilizing 
maximally permissive licenses, allowing incorporation into free and commercial 
software without restriction. The intention is to create a standard platform, 
with no barriers to use or incorporation into other systems.

## Architectural Foundations

Building simple, stable, long-term foundations for a new generation of information 
topologies All of the technologies described rest on solid, distributed, ultra-scalable 
information foundations. Our data layer and our foundations are made to be 
shared with a rich ecosystem of current and forthcoming applications.

## We Value

* Openness
* Privacy
* Autonomy
* Distributability
* Content addressable storage
* Individual data ownership
* Local storage
* Meritocracy
* Freedom

## Open Source Ethos

Software Zero is being developed as a volunteer effort, supported by our team’s 
belief in the power and promise of these platforms.
