“Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, he is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organisation founded in 1994 which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. He was a Director of the Web Science Trust (WST) launched in 2009 to promote research and education in Web Science, the multidisciplinary study of humanity connected by technology.

Tim is a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation, launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.

He has promoted open government data globally and is a member of the UK’s Transparency Board.”

“The IEML research program promotes a radical innovation in the notation and processing of semantics. IEML (Information Economy MetaLanguage) is a regular language that provides new methods for semantic interoperability, semantic navigation, collective categorization and self-referential collective intelligence. This research program is compatible with the major standards of the Web of data and is in tune with the current trends in social computing.

The vision paper explains the philosophical relevance of this new language, expounds its syntactic and semantic structures and ponders its possible implications for the growth of collective intelligence in cyberspace.”

In my view, Pierre and the Collective Intelligence Lab at the University of Ottowa are implicitly working to provide foundational structures for a potential symbiotic human/machine super-organism.

[Birth of a Global Mind](http://fora.tv/2012/09/05/Tim_OReilly_Birth_of_the_Global_Mind)

“Tim O’Reilly discusses how evolving technology has disrupted society, and has given birth to the global mind. “The history of civilization is a story of evolution in our ability to build complex ‘multicellular minds,’” says Tim O’Reilly, founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media (books, conferences, foo camps, Maker Faires, Make magazine.)

Speech allowed us to communicate and coordinate. Writing allowed that coordination to span time and space. Twentieth century mass communications allowed shared information and culture to blanket the world. In the 21st century, memes spread mind to mind in nearly real time.

But that’s not all. In one breakthrough computer application after another, we see a new kind of man-machine symbiosis. The Google autonomous vehicle turns out not to be just a triumph of artificial intelligence algorithms. The car is guided by the cloud memory of roads driven before by human Google Streetview drivers augmented by powerful and precise new sensors. In the same way, crowd-sourced data from sensor-enabled humans is leading to smarter cities, breakthroughs in healthcare, and new economies.

The future belongs not to artificial intelligence, but to collective intelligence.”

##[Co-Intelligence Institute](http://www.co-intelligence.org/)

Co-intelligence is emerging through new developments in democracy, organizational development, collaborative processes, the Internet and systems sciences like ecology and complexity. Today millions of people are involved in co-creating co-intelligence. Our diverse efforts grow more effective as we discover we are part of a larger evolutionary enterprise, and as we learn together and from each other. 

##[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential](http://www.uia.be/encyclopedia-world-problems-and-human-potential)

Research relating to the publication the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential represents some of the most progressive and innovative work conducted at the UIA. The Encyclopedia is the result of an ambitious effort, since 1972, to collect and present information on the problems humanity is confronted with, as well as the challenges such problems pose to concept formation, values and development strategies.

##[Earth Dashboard](http://earthdash.org/DraftDash/earthdashboard3/index.php)

The Earth Dashboard you are visiting is an alpha version of a tool that is intended to provide a unitary, global perspective on the real-time condition of our world, as well as the direction in which we are moving, and what we can do to change that direction, if we so desire. It is our experimental lab where we develop and try out new data display widgets and new indicators, or existing indicators in new widgets, new indicators in differing formats, differing arrangements and juxtapositions of indicators, and new arrangements of pages. We are or will also be experimenting with the user interface, graphic design and features that will be added in the near future to the Earth Dashboard (see below, Coming Attractions). Most of our work is on the level of coding, functionality of the widgets and the “best” widget for displaying each indicator. Your suggestions and help on any of the above and below are welcome.

It is only by moving from the idea of individual protection to the idea of protection of all that we can start to envisage the possibility of a global social contract.

##[Living Earth Simulator](http://www.futurict.eu/)

"FuturICT wants science to catch up with the speed at which new problems and opportunities are arising in our changing world as consequences of globalization, technological, demographic and environmental change, and make a contribution to strengthening our societies' adaptiveness, resilience, and sustainability.

It will do so by developing new scientific approaches and combining these with the best established methods in areas like multi-scale computer modeling, social supercomputing, large-scale data mining and participatory platforms. "
