Starting with the idea of **:::Collaborating Like a Hacker:::** inspired by Harlan T Wood's well appreciated blog post: [What if we checked the commons into Github] (http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/What_if_We_Checked_the_Commons_into_Github/index.html)
This repository is awaiting to be hosted by a collective account.

Conversation-to-Action Pull Platform
====================================

Empowering a network of issues-related learning and collaborative environments leading to action. Its goal is to make open-ended conversations generative or 'productive' in terms of engagement, resources pulled and pooled, outputs and outcomes

Enabling technology and information to get to those who need it, to become a global collective intelligence solution and governance space

We need to multiply the generative potential of conversations around social objects that  attract individual intentions into collective effort through an emergent  platform which enables: 
* Harvesting and productivity of conversations
* Contextual linking of objects and push pull
* Visualization & navigation in contextualized data
* Social network communication channels enabling communication

What is needed from the tool emerges readily when it is used in line with some embodied and meaningful purpose.

## Harvesting & Making Conversations Productive

We need conversations that are dynamic and ongoing and can adapt. (flow)

We need to be able to start conversations with no structure and enable the structure to emerge.

We need conversations where we can go back and reflect – turn the asynchronicity in time & space in an opportunity for making new sense rather than diverging  (reflection)

We need an infinite cannevas, that can enable lots of stuff. 
* Wikis don't respond to needs (no construction of discourse)
* Blogs don't respond to needs (no synthesis/merging of argumentation) 
* [Blog as a tip of a wiki iceberg] (http://communitywiki.org/en/BlogControlledByWiki)?

### Overall Requirements  

Sharing & learning

Capture, harvest content of conversations in all multimedia forms.

Make what we each have and the outputs visible and accessible

Enable cross silo understanding (Pattern/link languages and protocols)

Enable contextualization and cross-reference of data and content

Contextualize interdependencies, convergences, divergences through visualization of linked data

Enable figuring out what is ongoing. Help people see what is happening.  Clearly showing progress and impact, 'evolution in the making' (making aware through engagement)

Host and channel the emergence of new patterns. (actionable insights)

Search and navigate the adjacent possibles (exploration)

Specify intents 
* Express our current and future desired/preferred contexts in relation to our reality and visualized interdependencies
* Synchronize intents with purposes, to let the world orient itself around our visions. Example [Move Commons] (http://movecommons.org/about/)

Synchronize resources and needs to maximize potential and impact

Pull people and resources around [social objects as ‘attractors’] (http://www.slideshare.net/jess3/the-world-of-social-objects) – 

Push possibilities, match people and objects – Platform is people and conversation centric

Create Contextualized Connections (revalue reap the potential of the hyperlink)
* Ping things, concepts, people, data into a conversation (Pull Platform mechanism).
* Point out objects that need work. Notify those that might be interested.
* Ping from wherever you are within documents etc (rizzoma, Kune,  Hackpad) ideally via portable identities like email portability.
* Link to context and follow from wherever you are "hook" (to people -response to-, conversations, posts –reference to-, data update etc)

Pull related data from the web on ongoing basis

Enable generative conversations to grow into something more comprehensive
* Dispatching to where content needs to be processed
* Processing of content and iteration: curation, learning, annotation,  evaluation, argumentation, decision, action – contextualized and cross  referenced) (debategraph, Kune)
* Self discovery space, taking notes, adding on, modifying (sandbox)
* Hands on modifying and scaling – fork, diff, merge. (re: open source - github)
* Transition from [unstructured to structured] (http://www.communitywiki.org/en/StructureOfWikis) and reprocess the history into a structure.

Enable Learning and discovery - Paying Attention, Doing, and Learning. 

Broadcast to a larger audience for diffusion (push) or input (pull)

Co-generation of narrative, collective authorship in multimedia (co-creation). Example [The exquisite forest] (http://www.exquisiteforest.com/)

Make  the process seamless, fluid and transparent, as effortless as possible  in order to focus on the learning, interactions and sense making.  (integration of modules and protocols)

Need infrastructure on which to build this
Put on top structure, processes, protocols - organizing metaphors, narratives, enablers

### Specific Features and possibilities

**Framework - knowledege management system**

* Tagging that allows allow for drill down hierarchies to form.
     
  > Allows a file to be found through multiple different associative network without having to keep multiple copies of a file.
    
* Syncing/Updating of files in different locations.
     
  > Similar to above, allows a file to updated across many locations. Prevents the necessity of finding the perfect place for the file to be found.
    
* The ability to create infinitely nested folder structures.
     
  > Obviously, for organization of topic/sub.
    
* Integration of folder structures with native file-systems
     
  > Allows for more access and easier migration. ( Wheel-Chair Ramps)
    
* Meta-Commenting System
     
  > Comment on file without changing the file itself. Allows for conversation about what is being done to happen.

* Multiple accounts working on a file at once.
       
  > Obvious efficiency and collaboration purposes.
    
* Easy indication who is making which changes to a file
       
  > Obvious credential purposes.

* Revision Histories
     
  > Documentation of RAW data changes over-time. Can be used, for example, to do processes analysis.    
    
* Embedding of files in other medium
       
  > Distribution purposes
    
* Cross-platform
       
  > Does anything need to be said?


**Pinging**

A  right-click option in web documents that would insert popup comparison  tables to fill in (visible to others via a subtle tag, or upon a cursor  mouseover). The popup tables might be embedded, conditionally-visible  new SocialCompare tables that would let us see side by side comments,  alternative wordings, related diagrams – or whatever people wanted to  offer. (Mark Frazier)

A  hashtag comparison table when creating content on socialNets that  would, sort of the way Quora suggest topics, let you know what hashtags  most people are following related to your subject. (Zaq)


**Tagging and harvesting multimedia**

* Interface  software to record our voices and send us all transcripts. Currently  > make an audio record of skype calls with (free) Callburner, or  video recording Skype calls with free Vodburner. Create transcripts from  Professional Edition of Dragon speech recognition software. Gizmo.

* Combine video chat with a text box and a twitter backchannel

* Printable record that can be reviewed with highlighters of different colors and  analyzed for discovering patterns of connection and meaning that were  not readily graspable during the exchange, thus allowing to discover  further layers of what has been trying to be communicated through us  (George Por)

Make  an audio record of skype calls with Callburner which is free, and even  video recordings of skype video calls with free Vodburner. (Have them,  never used them, don’t know how good they are.) I imagine those digital  files could then be fed into the Professional Edition of Dragon speech  recognition software which can make text from digital audio files.
