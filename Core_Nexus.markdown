[Co-Intelligence Institute](http://www.co-intelligence.org/)
Co-intelligence is emerging through new developments in democracy, organizational development, collaborative processes, the Internet and systems sciences like ecology and complexity. Today millions of people are involved in co-creating co-intelligence. Our diverse efforts grow more effective as we discover we are part of a larger evolutionary enterprise, and as we learn together and from each other. 

[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential](http://www.uia.be/encyclopedia-world-problems-and-human-potential)
Research relating to the publication the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential represents some of the most progressive and innovative work conducted at the UIA. The Encyclopedia is the result of an ambitious effort, since 1972, to collect and present information on the problems humanity is confronted with, as well as the challenges such problems pose to concept formation, values and development strategies.

[Earth Dashboard](http://earthdash.org/DraftDash/earthdashboard3/index.php)
The Earth Dashboard you are visiting is an alpha version of a tool that is intended to provide a unitary, global perspective on the real-time condition of our world, as well as the direction in which we are moving, and what we can do to change that direction, if we so desire. It is our experimental lab where we develop and try out new data display widgets and new indicators, or existing indicators in new widgets, new indicators in differing formats, differing arrangements and juxtapositions of indicators, and new arrangements of pages. We are or will also be experimenting with the user interface, graphic design and features that will be added in the near future to the Earth Dashboard (see below, Coming Attractions). Most of our work is on the level of coding, functionality of the widgets and the “best” widget for displaying each indicator. Your suggestions and help on any of the above and below are welcome.
